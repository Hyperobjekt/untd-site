graphHeading: What is socioeconomic mobility?
graphSubheading: "[Socioeconomic mobility](/research-library/) is the movement
  of people between economic and/or social groups within a society. In the
  United States, we have coined this type of upward mobility as the American
  Dream. The odds of achieving this kind of upward mobility have, unfortunately,
  dwindled for most Americans despite massive economic growth. This site will
  help provide insights into factors that can lead to or arise from low rates of
  socioeconomic mobility and contextualize that with data focused on North
  Texas. Finally, this site is focused on the ways that knowledge on upward
  mobility can be put to action, and how the chances for upward mobility can be
  increased for all communities."
