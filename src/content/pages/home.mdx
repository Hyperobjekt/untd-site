graphHeading: What is socioeconomic mobility?
graphSubheading: "[Socioeconomic mobility](/research-library/) is the movement
  of people between economic and/or social groups within a society. In the
  United States this type of upward mobility is best represented as the American
  Dream. Unfortunately, the odds of achieving this kind of upward mobility have
  dwindled for many Americans. This website highlights research that can help us
  understand factors linked with upward, and downward, mobility. Want to put the
  research to action and change the odds for upward mobility for children across
  the region."
