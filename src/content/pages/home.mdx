graphHeading: What is socioeconomic mobility?
graphSubheading: "[Socioeconomic mobility](/research-library/) is, at its

  a society. Prospects for upward socioeconomic mobility, however, are not
  guaranteed for all Americans - since the 1970s upward mobility across society
  has been largely stagnant."
