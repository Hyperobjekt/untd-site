      ## Opportunities for upward mobility vary drastically across North Texas.


      In some communities, children are more likely to grow up in stable, supportive homes with access to resources that boost their odds of finishing high school, going to college or vocational school, and having a stable, supportive family of their own. However, the odds are stacked against too many children in too many other neighborhoods - communities that are often poor as a result of systemic disinvestment from local governments or real estate markets. These neighborhoods, often ones of color, experience a cyclical churn of economic and social stress.

      ## Disrupting the cycle may be possible.


      Thanks to cutting edge research from academics, we are beginning to quantify the impact that historic disinvestment, racism, and trauma have had on our communities. Fueled with this knowledge, local governments, nonprofits, and businesses are developing and testing strategies that are showing promising results.

      ## We want to help


      We want to help make that information available to as many people as we can - community leaders, policymakers, advocates, and entrepreneurs - so that they can tie that research into our current knowledge of North Texas as they create new solutions to foster upward economic mobility for everyone who calls North Texas home.
