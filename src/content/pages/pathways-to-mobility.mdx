      # Students helping nonprofit redesign their programs to align with best
      practices related to increasing socioeconomic mobility


      A group of students has been paired with a nonprofit organization that hopes to re-design some of its programs to ensure that they give participants the best chance of economic mobility. In this scenario, a key set of questions focuses on the different programs in place at the organization today and linking those to what we know about barriers to and drivers of upward socioeconomic mobility.


      To tackle this project, the students need to answer a few questions that will help them understand if the nonprofits programs are aligned to research on socioeconomic mobility. Asking these of each program will help them determine the degree to which this alignment exists and where small changes could be made to increase the impact of the organizations work on increasing mobility for their clients.

      indicators that we know are deeply related to limited mobility, but the
      effectiveness of these approaches will vary based on the many compounding
      factors that could come into play.

      for completing an associateâ€™s degree may cause a shift away from
      traditional four-year universities in deeply impoverished communities,
      ultimately limiting the degree of growth for already struggling places.
      They may also fail if too few children make it to the point of deciding to
      attend some form of postsecondary institution.

      expect from interventions designed to boost socioeconomic mobility in
      North Texas if they were rolled out at various scales and degrees of
      success. These approaches are intended to start the conversation around
      how we might plan on understanding the impacts of the various policies
      that we want.
