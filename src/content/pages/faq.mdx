questions:
  - question: What is the NTX Social Mobility Hub, and why was it created?
    answer:
      The NTX Social Mobility Hub is a local resource intended to help local
      decision makers access the best research and data related to upward
      economic and social mobility. The Hub was developed to identify
      opportunities for improving the outcomes of North Texas’ children from all
      backgrounds. We hope that the resources and data that we have compiled
      here can help spur new projects to boost mobility across the region.
  - answer: This website was created by the Child Poverty Action Lab, with
      development support from Hyperobjekt, and the input of numerous local
      stakeholders working to improve outcomes for children across North Texas.
      Staff with UNT Dallas also provided guidance on the vision for this site
      and connections to the work of the Center on Socioeconomic Mobility
      Through Learning.
    question: Who created the NTX Social Mobility Hub?

    answer:

    answer:
      The Hub is intended to be a living website, with updates to the data and
      research findings made on a regular basis. If you have suggestions for
      content we should include, please let us know by reaching out through the

  - question: How was information for this website compiled?
    answer: >-
      The data, research, and projects organized on this site were compiled by
      the Child Poverty Action Lab (CPAL) and other organizations working to
      advance knowledge of socioeconomic mobility across the United States. We
      owe gratitude to many organizations, especially Opportunity Insights,
      Urban Institute, Brookings Institution, Results for America, and others
      who have helped make this type of information more accessible. 

      All links to references and resources on this site are to the public facing sites, although some content may require payment to access in full (e.g. journal articles).
  - question: How was the data for the Explorer gathered?
    answer:
      Data for this website was accessed from publicly available sources, such
      as the U.S. Census Bureau, or compiled through open records requests from
      various state or local agencies. For more information on exactly how we
      gathered the data, visit our public-facing GitHub repository. There you
      will find information on where we accessed the data, how we processed it
      for incorporating it into the site, and any limitations or assumptions
      that you should be aware of. If you still have questions after reviewing
      that information, let us know by visiting the Contact page!
  - question: Is the data on this site available for use in my work?
    answer:
      Yes. You can visit our public GitHub repository to access the data files
      used to populate the Data Explorer. In addition to the data files (in
      .geojson, .csv, and .xlsx), you will find the R code we used to generate
      much of the content on this website. You may use that code to inspire
      future projects, boost your workflow, or to help in your work to boost
      upward mobility.
  - question: I am looking for data that isn’t hosted on this website. Are there
      other resources I might consider?
